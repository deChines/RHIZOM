				“a rhizome grows under the ground, under your
				feet. you are not witnessing the interconnection
				until it sprouts - wherever the soil is the
				most favourable."<br><br>

				the interdisciplinary festival named rhizom has
				developed out of a collective dedicated to cultivating
				alternative electronic music and arts.
				it commits itself to uniqueness, character, innovation,
				passion and diy-spirit.
				at the rhizom festival the social responsibility
				of culture and its consumers will be discussed
				and envisioned through readings, film, dance,
				music, video and installation art. untypical, organizational
				initiatives will be tested. gathering
				moments will allow connection for further
				creation. the rhizom will sprout.<br><br>

				“rhizomatic sonic practice mutates forms,
				continuously readapting itself. it shakes stagnating
				grounds with the power of movement,
				hijacks gravity into a horizontal choreography
				of equal bodies and polyrythmic interdependency."

					the rhizom festival premieres at rote fabrik in
	zurich from 19th to 21st of mai 2018.
	the rhizom festival is a non-profit festival organised
	by the zurich collective vazem, it relies on a
	strong volunteering/helper basis. its aim is to be
	accessible for everybody. musicians and spectators
	should get in touch through music, art and
	discussions. feel welcome, be welcome!
	where?
	rote fabrik, seestrasse 395

	car: there's no parking available on site!
	tickets? prix libre!
	the organisers have decided that there will be no
	fix entry price. each participant is free to decide
	what amount they are willing or able to pay. we
	recommend an entry-price of chf 20.00/day. no
	physical tickets will be sold. get a stamp at the
	box office.
	prix libre?
	the collective is convinced that no one should
	renounce to culture and entertainment because
	of financial limitations. the prix libre concept
	encourages people to reflect about which components
	are relevant to them, when it comes to
	putting a price on something. for example: the
	appreciation of the work done for the festival,
	the support of the project, the expenses involved
	or the idea of making culture and entertainment
	accessible for all. it also enables a fair and equal
	pricing, adjusted to one’s individual resources,
	and empowers all participants.
	the prix libre allows the organisers to create a
	festival without being profitable, without imposing
	pricing views on participants and to distance
	themselves from the value society imposes to
	human labour.
	get in in advance? donate!
	the festival’s capacity is limited. but you can
	secure your entry in donating (see instructions
	below). you can donate as much as you want. as
